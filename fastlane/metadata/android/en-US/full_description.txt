An Open Source Child Monitor for Android
Child Monitor allows two Android devices to act as a baby monitor. The first device, left in the room with the baby, will advertise itself on the network and stream audio to a connected client. The second device, with the parent, will connect to the monitoring device and receive an audio stream.

Child Monitor works on Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and newer, i.e. Android SDK 21.
Warning: This version of Child Monitor is incompatible with versions older than 1.0!

<p>An Open Source Child Monitor for Android</p>
<p>Child Monitor allows two Android devices to act as a baby monitor. The first device, left in the room with the baby, will advertise itself on the network and stream audio to a connected client. The second device, with the parent, will connect to the monitoring device and receive an audio stream.</p>
<p>The project is a fork of Protect Baby Monitor which is declared as "on hiatus" by its developer.</p>
<p>Child Monitor works on Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and newer, i.e. Android SDK 21.</p>
<p>Warning: This version of Child Monitor is incompatible with versions older than 1.0!</p>
<p>Bugfix in this release: Wrong color scaling of volume monitor background.</p>
